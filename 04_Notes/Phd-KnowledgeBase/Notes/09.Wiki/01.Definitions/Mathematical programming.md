Linear programming is a mathematical programming technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear [inequality constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/inequality-constraint) [57]. It solves the optimization problem using algorithms such as the primal simplex algorithm, the dual simplex algorithm, and the interior-point algorithm.
