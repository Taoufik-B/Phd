Notes:

The next wave of computing is about devices that communicate and coordinate.

Mission: Endow autonomous agents with intelligence that enables them to cooperate towards common goals.

  

Many applications are foreseen:

- Logistics
- Surveillance,
- Construction
- Agriculture …

Experiment of multiple agents (cars) on a simple curved road, shows that without cooperation, a queue is formed on the blocked lane due to a stopped agent.

  

-> What happen with decentralized decision algorithm ?

The cars are slowing down to enable safe lane change manoeuvre to avoid the blocking car

  

How to effectively communicate among agents to coordinate, cooperate, collaborate? #question

Data driven model or principle model.

The focus of the presentation is on data driven model.

  

Agent-agent relationship can be represented as **graphs. Exploit structure** of underlying data to facilitate the learning problem.
