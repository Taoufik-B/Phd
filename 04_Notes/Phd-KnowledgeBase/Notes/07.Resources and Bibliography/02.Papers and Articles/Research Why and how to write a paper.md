Most important success factor for doing research:

- Persistence
- Organisation
- Dedication
- Resources
- Inquisitive mind

  

It is important to organize the pertinent references. I recommend transferring all abstracts to your computer. Keep

them organized by putting them in alphabetical order by the first authorâ€™s last name. Make notes on the abstracts as

pertinent. Make an outline of what you have found in your review

  

**Writing the manuscript**

The main sections of the manuscript are the abstract (summary), the introduction (why?), the materials and methods

(how?), the results (what you found), and the discussion (so what)

  

When I write a manuscript, I write the sections in

the following order. First, I write the material and methods

section. This section is the easiest to write --- just cut and

paste from the protocol (remember to change tenses from

future to past). Then, I write the results with the liberal

use of tables and graphs. I next write the introduction while

relying heavily on the protocol. I do not write the introduction initially because the results of the study may alter it

somewhat. Afterwards, I write the discussion. Lastly, I write

the abstract so that it will be consistent with the remainder

of the paper.

  

**Writing the discussion**

Without a doubt this is the most difficult part of the paper to

write.4 Before I start writing the discussion, I always make

an outline of what I want to include. In the outline, the

first paragraph is a brief summary of the results of the study

and the last paragraph is the conclusion. The other paragraphs in the discussion should compare the results of the

present study with those reported previously, the clinical

implications and limitations of the study.
