**Date: [November 05, 2023]**

  

**Tasks Completed Today:**

5. ==Read the paper on "POMDPs in Autonomous Vehicles" - found valuable insights regarding sensor noise.==
6. ==Completed the coding for the preliminary simulation model.==
7. ==Met with Dr. XYZ for feedback on the research proposal.==

**Highlights & Key Takeaways:**

9. ==The paper emphasized the importance of real-time data processing in POMDPs for autonomous driving.==
10. ==Dr. XYZ suggested exploring more on the hybrid models that combine POMDPs with other AI techniques.==

**Challenges Faced:**

12. ==Faced issues with the simulation model in terms of scalability.==
13. ==Struggled with understanding some of the mathematical derivations in the paper.==

**Plans for Tomorrow:**

15. ==Debug the simulation model.==
16. ==Start with the next paper in the reading list - "Hybrid Models in Autonomous Driving".==
17. ==Schedule a meeting with the coding team for synchronization.==

**Personal Reflections: (A space for subjective feelings, thoughts, or concerns)**

19. ==Feeling optimistic about the research direction after today's meeting.==
20. ==Need to manage time better to avoid late-night work sessions.==
