Optimality, in the context of mathematical optimization and control theory, refers to the condition of achieving the best possible solution to a problem under given constraints. It is a fundamental concept in various fields, including economics, operations research, and engineering. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### Definition and Key Concepts

1. **Optimal Solution**: 
   - This is the best possible outcome or decision that maximizes or minimizes a certain objective function, a mathematical expression representing the goal of the problem (like cost, efficiency, performance, etc.).
   - For example, in a fuel optimization problem for a vehicle, the optimal solution would be the set of control actions that minimize fuel consumption over a certain journey.

2. **Objective Function**:
   - A function that needs to be optimized (either maximized or minimized). The form of this function and the variables involved depend on the specific problem.
   - In the context of your MPC research, the objective function could be a combination of factors like energy efficiency, travel time, and safety.

3. **Constraints**:
   - These are limitations or requirements that the solution must adhere to. Constraints can be equality constraints (e.g., conservation laws) or inequality constraints (e.g., physical limitations, safety regulations).
   - In autonomous vehicle navigation, constraints could include vehicle dynamics, road boundaries, speed limits, and collision avoidance.

### Types of Optimality

1. **Global Optimality**: 
   - A solution is globally optimal if there is no other feasible solution that yields a better value of the objective function.
   - Global optimality is often desired but can be challenging to achieve, especially in complex or nonlinear problems.

2. **Local Optimality**:
   - A solution is locally optimal if it is the best within a small surrounding region. It might not be the best overall when considering the entire feasible set.
   - Many optimization algorithms, especially for nonlinear problems, can guarantee only local optimality.

### Optimality in MPC

In Model Predictive Control, optimality involves finding control actions that optimize the objective function (like minimizing the error between the desired and predicted trajectory) over a prediction horizon, subject to constraints (like vehicle dynamics and safety rules). The challenge is to balance the achievement of optimality with computational efficiency, especially in real-time applications like autonomous driving.

### Conclusion

Optimality is a cornerstone concept in decision-making and optimization problems. Achieving an optimal solution means finding the best possible outcome within the defined parameters of the problem. In practical scenarios, especially those involving complex systems or real-time decision-making, one often has to balance between achieving near-optimality and maintaining computational feasibility.
