## Abstract:
```

```
Contains the resume of your work. You began with a short description of your
```

```
problematic then you introduces your contribution globally and summarize the
```

```
most important result that you obtain.

## Introduction
```

```
It
’
s a kind of development of what you have written in the abstract. It
’
s must
```

```
includes yours aims, methodology, used approaches and most important result.
```

```
At the end you must put the global structure of your document.
```

```
## Background
```

```
It
’
s kind of bibliographic work from which you took the important approaches
```

```
used to solve the same problem which you work on. You have to made some
```

```
comparison with your methods and other methods used by other researcher.
```

```
## Modelling and simulation
```

```
In this part you must introduce how you have models the problematic. You
```

```
must also justifies the choice of resolution method and finally you must give
```

```
some level of details about the implementation process.
```

```
Result and discussion
```

```
you began by presenting the obtained result for every realised simulation (table
```

```
of values, graphics ...) then you write your analysis of those results and finally
```

```
you concluded by comparing your results to those obtained by other researchers.
```

```
## Conclusion and perspective
```

```
In this section you summarize what you have done in the previous section and
```

```
you give the reader some path to follow for more development of your method.
