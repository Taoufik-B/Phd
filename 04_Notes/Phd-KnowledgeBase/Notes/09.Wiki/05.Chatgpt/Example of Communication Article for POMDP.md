==Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled framework for decision making under uncertainty, but solving them is notoriously difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. Recently, deep learning has been shown to be effective in solving some of these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Deep POMDP, which uses deep neural networks to learn policies directly from POMDP belief states. We use a convolutional neural network to encode the POMDP belief state, and a recurrent neural network to predict the optimal action. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP solvers on a range of benchmark problems, and is able to scale to larger and more complex problems.==
