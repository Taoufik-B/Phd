Addressing cluttered environments is an important research area in robotics, and it involves developing algorithms and techniques for efficient navigation, obstacle avoidance, object recognition, and manipulation in such challenging settings. This is particularly relevant for robots operating in real-world scenarios, where cluttered environments are common in homes, offices, factories, and outdoor spaces.
