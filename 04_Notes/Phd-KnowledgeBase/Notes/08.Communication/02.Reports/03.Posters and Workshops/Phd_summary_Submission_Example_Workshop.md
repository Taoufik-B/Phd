**Title: Enhancing Decision-Making in Autonomous Vehicles through a Unified POMDP, MPC, and Probabilistic Robotics Framework**

**Introduction:** ~~In the burgeoning field of autonomous driving, the complexity of multi-agent environments presents significant challenges for decision-making systems. My PhD research focuses on developing an innovative framework that synergizes Model Predictive Control (MPC), Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and Probabilistic Robotics. This approach aims to address the intricate dynamics and uncertainties characteristic of urban driving scenarios.~~

The domain of autonomous vehicle navigation, particularly in the context of densely populated urban environments, poses a multitude of challenges for contemporary decision-making systems. My doctoral research endeavors to address these complexities by pioneering an integrative framework that coalesces the methodologies of Model Predictive Control (MPC), Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and Probabilistic Robotics. This venture aims to substantially elevate the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to negotiate the intricate and often unpredictable dynamics typical of urban driving scenarios.

**Objectives:** The primary goal of this research is to create a robust decision-making framework that significantly improves the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles in dynamic, uncertain environments. Key objectives include:

1. Developing a unified framework that integrates the predictive power of MPC, the uncertainty management of POMDPs, and the real-time state estimation of Probabilistic Robotics.
2. Validating this framework within the CARLA simulator, particularly focusing on complex urban intersections where multi-agent interactions are most challenging.

**Methodology:** The research employs a layered approach, beginning with advanced sensor data processing to accurately perceive the driving environment. State estimation techniques from Probabilistic Robotics are used to interpret this data, feeding into a POMDP model that formulates decision-making strategies. These strategies are then executed through an MPC scheme, ensuring optimal real-time control actions. The CARLA simulator serves as the primary platform for testing and validating the framework under varied urban driving conditions.

**Key Findings:** While the research is ongoing, preliminary simulations in CARLA have shown promising results in enhancing decision accuracy and response times in complex traffic scenarios. The framework demonstrates potential in significantly reducing collision risks and improving navigational efficiency.

**Significance:** This research contributes to the autonomous driving field by addressing one of its core challenges: reliable decision-making in unpredictable multi-agent environments. The novel integration of MPC, POMDPs, and Probabilistic Robotics offers a comprehensive approach that could set new standards in autonomous vehicle algorithms.

**Conclusion:** The next phase of my research involves extensive simulation testing, followed by real-world trials. I am keen to engage with experts in the field during the workshop to discuss potential collaborations, gain insights, and refine the framework further.
