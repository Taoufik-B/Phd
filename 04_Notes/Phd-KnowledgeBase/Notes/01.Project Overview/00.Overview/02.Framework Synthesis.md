**Application to the Problem Statement**==:==

==In the domain of autonomous driving, especially in complex multi-agent scenarios, a singular approach might not suffice due to the vast and dynamic nature of the challenges involved. By synergizing the principles of Model Predictive Control (MPC), Probabilistic Robotics, and POMDPs, a consolidated framework can be crafted to cater to these challenges effectively.==

**Steps Involved in Synthesis**==:==

1. **Component Understanding**==: Begin by delving deep into each methodology's fundamental principles, strengths, and limitations.==

- **MPC** ==offers a method to optimize control signals over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth navigation.==
- **Probabilistic Robotics** ==focuses on the uncertainties related to robot perception and action.==
- **POMDPs** ==address decision-making in the face of uncertainties about the current state and the outcomes of actions.==
2. **Identification of Overlap and Gaps**==: Find common grounds among the methods and identify where they can complement each other. For instance, while POMDP can decide the best action based on current belief states, MPC can help in executing that action optimally in a continuous space.==
3. **Integration Strategy**==: Design algorithms or techniques to bridge gaps and merge methodologies. For instance, the output of the POMDP decision-making process can be fed into the MPC for action execution. Similarly, the state estimates from Probabilistic Robotics can be inputs for the POMDP model.==
4. **Iterative Refinement**==: Once the initial integrated framework is set up, iterate over it. Test its performance, identify weak links, and refine the integration strategies. Simulation tools like CARLA can be beneficial during this stage.==
5. **Validation**==: After refining, validate the synthesized framework against traditional approaches and benchmarks. This not only tests its efficacy but also highlights its strengths and areas of improvement.==

**Expected Outcome**==:==

==The synthesized framework should offer a holistic decision-making mechanism for autonomous vehicles. It should be adaptable, scalable, robust, and, most importantly, efficient in multi-agent environments. It should optimally use the predictive nature of MPC, the uncertainty handling of Probabilistic Robotics, and the decision-making prowess of POMDPs to navigate complex scenarios.==

  

==In essence, the synthesis of a framework is a meticulous process that demands an in-depth understanding of its components. However, when executed with precision, it can offer solutions that redefine the boundaries of what's achievable in the domain.==
