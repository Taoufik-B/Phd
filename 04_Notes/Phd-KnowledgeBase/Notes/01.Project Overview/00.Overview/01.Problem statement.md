**Title**: _Holistic Decision-making Framework for Autonomous Vehicles in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environments_

In the evolving domain of autonomous driving, intricate multi-agent systems like CARLA pose profound challenges in decision-making. These challenges stem from the unpredictable dynamics and interactions that traditional control strategies struggle to address effectively. While principles such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), Probabilistic Robotics, and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) hold significant promise, there is a pronounced need for a consolidated framework that seamlessly integrates these elements.

**Primary Aim**: To conceptualize, develop, and validate a unified decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) tailored for dynamic multi-agent scenarios.
