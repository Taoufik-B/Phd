**------**

==Goal for CW4123:==

**Finalize Specific Problem Statement**==:==

23. ==Analyse the Topic Relevance:== [Analysis approach](Analysis%20approach.md)
    
    - ==Review literature to understand how your chosen problem aligns with current trends in the domain.==
    - ==Determine the potential impact of your research on the field of autonomous vehicles.==
24. ==Narrow the Research:== [Narrow the Research](Narrow%20the%20Research.md)
    
    - ==Determine the specific challenges within POMDPs for autonomous vehicles you want to address.==
    - ==Consider any technological or theoretical gaps that your research can bridge.==

==Tasks:==

**Organizational**==:==

27. ==OneNote Management:== [00.Proposed OneNote Organization](00.Proposed%20OneNote%20Organization.md)
    
    - ==Dedicate time slots on Saturday and Sunday to organize and plan your OneNote.==
    - ==Create separate sections or tabs for different aspects like literature, notes, references, etc.==
28. ==Research Notes:== [Research Note-taking Template:](Research%20Note-taking%20Template.md)
    
    - ==Allocate time daily to make notes on the papers/articles you read.==
    - ==Consider using a template for consistency.==
29. ==Literature Management:==
    
    - ==Start populating your bibliography. If not done already, consider using a tool like Mendeley for better management.==
    - ==Review and organize existing literature. Categorize them based on relevance, methodology, or theme.==

**Technical Focus**==:==

31. ==MPC and Probabilistic Robotics:== [MPC &](MPC%20%20Probabilistic%20Robotics) Probabilistic Robotics
    
    - ==Dedicate specific days to dive deep into these topics.==
    - ==Identify the intersection between these and POMDPs== ==:== [Intersection](MPC%20%20Probabilistic%20Robotics)
32. ==Implementation and Development:==
    
    - ==Regularly update your Github repository. Make sure every commit is meaningful.==
    - ==Consider setting up a Kanban board in Github Projects to manage tasks and track progress.==
    - ==As you progress, ensure your README is updated. Explore tools like Jekyll or GitHub Pages to transform your README into a more detailed project website.==

**Learning & Skill Development**==:==

34. ==Courses and E-books:==
    
    - ==Prioritize courses or reading material that align closely with your weekly goals.==
    - ==Allocate specific time blocks for learning. Consider the Pomodoro technique for focused sessions.==
35. ==Best Practices and Guidelines:==
    
    - ==As you work, note down any effective practices or tools that enhance your workflow. This can be beneficial in the long run.==
    - ==Explore how ChatGPT and other AI tools can assist in literature review, note-taking, or even brainstorming.==
36. ==Review Literature:==
    
    - ==Regularly revisit your bibliography.==
    - ==Consider setting up alerts on databases for keywords related to your research to stay updated.==
  

==With these detailed objectives and tasks, you have a roadmap for CW4123. Remember to periodically check your progress, and be flexible – adjust tasks if needed based on the flow of the week. Good luck with your research endeavors!==
