------------------------------

**1. Scope and Focus:**

Given your timeline and challenges, it might be helpful to narrow down the focus. Instead of broadly looking at POMDPs for autonomous vehicles, consider a specific challenge or aspect of the driving task that would benefit from a POMDP formulation. For example: "Safe lane changing in high-density traffic using POMDPs" or "Intersection navigation under uncertainty with POMDPs". This will allow you to generate results and insights that are publishable.

**2. Literature Review:**

Before diving deep into implementation, ensure you have a comprehensive literature review. ==Identify gaps== in current research or aspects of the problem that haven't been thoroughly addressed. This will help position your research in the broader field and highlight its uniqueness.

**3. Simplicity First:**

Start with a simplified version of your problem in CARLA or even a custom environment. For example, model a 2-agent system before diving into multi-agent complexities. This way, you can validate your POMDP approach's viability before adding more layers of complexity.

**4. Seek Assistance:**

If you're struggling with implementation, don't hesitate to ask for help. This could be from peers, online forums, or workshops. The AI and robotics community can be quite supportive.

**5. Set Intermediate Goals:**

For your first paper, focus on presenting a novel formulation or insight related to POMDPs and autonomous vehicles, perhaps with preliminary results in a simplified environment. This could be a ==conference paper==.
For your second paper, you can present more refined results, possibly in the CARLA simulator with multi-agent scenarios, targeting a more reputable conference or journal.

**6. Time Management:**

Structure your remaining time efficiently. Set short-term goals, like monthly or even weekly goals. This will help maintain your progress and give you a sense of accomplishment.

**7. Seek Feedback:**

Before submission, get feedback on your paper drafts from peers, other faculty members, or even experts in the field if you can reach out to them. This will improve the quality and reception of your work.

**8. Consider Collaborations:**

If possible, collaborate with someone who complements your skills. If you're strong in theory but weak in implementation, find someone who can help bridge that gap. Collaboration can speed up research progress and enhance the quality of the output.
