==A Gantt chart or a simple timeline detailing the expected progression of your research==




## Timeline: [[Tasks_calendar]]

### 1. October 2023: Clarifying and Refining Research Direction 

- [R] [CW4123] **Week 1**: Finalize the specific [[01.Problem statement]]related to POMDPs in autonomous vehicles. A narrower focus will make the implementation and results more manageable. ⏫ 📅 2023-12-05
- [ ] [CW4323]**Week 2-3**: Deep dive into literature. Create a matrix of the existing solutions, their pros, cons, and gaps. 
- [ ] **Week 4**: Write a [Research proposal] or synopsis detailing your problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. 
  
### 2. November 2023: Preliminary Research and Simulation 

- [ ] **Week 1**: Familiarize yourself with CARLA or any other simulator you're using. Try basic scenarios without POMDPs to get a grasp of the simulator. 
- [ ] **Week 2-3**: Implement a basic POMDP algorithm, even if not related directly to your problem, to understand its mechanics.     
- [ ] **Week 4**: Begin modeling a simplified version of your chosen problem in the simulator.    
### 3. December 2023: Implementation and Testing 

- [ ] **Week 1-2**: Implement the POMDP approach to your specific problem in a simplified setting in the simulator. 
- [ ] **Week 3**: Test and debug. Document all findings, challenges, and results. 
- [ ] **Week 4**: Break and reflect. Given it's the holiday season, use this time to read, think, and gather your thoughts. Also, prepare a short progress report. 

### 4. January 2024: Refinement and Paper Drafting 

- [ ] **Week 1**: Refine your approach based on December's findings. Introduce any needed complexity.    
- [ ] **Week 2-3**: Begin drafting your first paper. Focus on the introduction, problem statement, and literature review. 
- [ ] **Week 4**: Write about your methodology and preliminary results. 

### 5. February 2024: Completion of First Paper 

- [ ] **Week 1**: Complete the results and discussion sections of your paper. 
- [ ] **Week 2**: Draft the conclusion and future work sections. Revise the entire draft. 
- [ ] **Week 3**: Get feedback from peers or other faculty. Revise based on feedback. 
- [ ] **Week 4**: Submit the paper to a suitable conference. 

### 6. March-April 2024: Advanced Implementation and Testing 

- [ ] **March**: Begin working on multi-agent scenarios in CARLA, taking your earlier work as a foundation. Address challenges and document findings. 
- [ ] **April**: Refine multi-agent scenarios and extract results for your second paper.    

### 7. May 2024: Drafting of Second Paper 

- [ ] **Week 1-2**: Draft the introduction, problem statement, literature review, and methodology of the second paper. 
- [ ] **Week 3**: Write the results and discussion sections. 
- [ ] **Week 4**: Draft conclusion and future work. 

### 8. June 2024: Finalizing Second Paper and Thesis Preparation 

- [ ] **Week 1**: Get feedback and finalize the second paper for submission. 
- [ ] **Week 2**: Start compiling your thesis. Your two papers will form its backbone. 
- [ ] **Week 3-4**: Draft the initial chapters of your thesis, including introduction, literature review, and methodology. 

### 9. July-August 2024: Thesis Compilation and Submission 

- [ ] **July**: Complete writing your thesis, including results, discussion, conclusion, and future work chapters. 
- [ ] **August**: Revise and get feedback. Perform any experiments or clarifications as needed. Submit the finalized thesis by end of August. 

### 9. September 2024: Thesis Defense

- [ ] **Week 1-2**: Prepare for the defense: create presentations, practice talks, and anticipate questions. 
- [ ] **Week 3-4**: Defend your thesis! 

This plan is aggressive, given the timeline, but it's structured to maximize your output. Regularly revisiting and adjusting this plan based on actual progress will be crucial. Remember, consistent effort, seeking feedback, and staying organized will be key. Good luck!
