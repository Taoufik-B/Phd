Certainly! Let's craft an acronym that incorporates "BELK" into the project's theme:

**B.E.L.K.: Bayesian Environmental Learning for Kinetics**

Where:

- Bayesian: Represents the probabilistic aspects of the project, especially related to the POMDPs.
- Environmental: Highlights the focus on real-world, multi-agent environments like CARLA.
- Learning: Emphasizes the adaptive nature of the system and its ability to refine its decision-making process.
- Kinetics: Reflects the movement and control aspects of autonomous vehicles, tying in the MPC.

So, the research project can be named: B.E.L.K. Framework: Bayesian Environmental Learning for Kinetics in Autonomous Vehicles.
