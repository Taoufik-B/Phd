## Reflections/Notes

**Key Objectives/Questions:**
Example: To explore the challenges and opportunities of implementing POMDPs in real-world multi-agent driving scenarios.

**Main Findings/Results:**
1. POMDPs present challenges in multi-agent environments due to X, Y, Z.
2. Proposed solution A improved computational efficiency by 20%.  

**Methodologies Used:**
Example: The authors used a hybrid approach combining traditional POMDPs with a new algorithm for faster computation.

**Relevance to My Research:**
Example: This paper's approach to improving computational efficiency in POMDPs can be beneficial for my own work on real-time decision making in autonomous vehicles.

**Key Quotations:**
Example: "Our findings suggest that while traditional POMDPs struggle in complex environments, hybrid solutions present a promising direction for future research."

**Personal Reflections/Thoughts:**
Example: While the paper presented a novel approach, there are still some questions about the scalability of their proposed solution. It would be interesting to experiment with their algorithm in a more diverse set of scenarios.
