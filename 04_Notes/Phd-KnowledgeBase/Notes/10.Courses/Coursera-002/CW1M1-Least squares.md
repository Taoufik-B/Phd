**Module 1 | Least squares**

- The history of the method least squares
- Ordinary and weighted least squares
- Recursive least squares
- Maximum likelihood and the method of least squares

  
  

**Key terms:**

- Localization is the method by which we determine the position and the orientation within the world

  

To accomplish the localization, we need state estimation, this is the process of computing a physical quantity from a set of measurements.
