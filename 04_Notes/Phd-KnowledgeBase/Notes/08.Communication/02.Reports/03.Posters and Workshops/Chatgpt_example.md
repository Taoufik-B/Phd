==Title: "Deep Learning Approach for Navigation in Unknown Environments using POMDP Formalism"==

  

**Abstract**==:==

==This study explores the use of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and deep learning for navigation in unknown environments. We present a novel approach that uses deep neural networks to learn policies for robot navigation in environments where the state is partially observable. The proposed approach is tested in simulation using the CARLA simulator, and the results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The implications of this research include the development of more robust and adaptive navigation systems for robots in unknown and dynamic environments.==

  

**Introduction**==:==

==Navigation in unknown and dynamic environments is a challenging problem for autonomous robots. In order to navigate effectively, robots must be able to perceive the environment, reason about their current state, and make decisions based on incomplete and uncertain information. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a powerful framework for addressing this problem, by modeling the robot's beliefs about the environment and incorporating this information into a decision-making process. Deep learning has also shown great promise for navigation tasks, by enabling robots to learn complex policies from sensory data. In this study, we combine POMDPs and deep learning to develop a novel approach for navigation in unknown environments.==

  

**Methodology**==:==

==Our approach uses deep neural networks to learn policies for robot navigation in POMDP environments. The neural network takes as input the robot's sensor readings and outputs an action to be taken. We train the network using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning, where the reward signal is based on the robot's ability to navigate to a given goal. The resulting policy is then used in a POMDP framework, where the robot's belief about the environment is updated at each time step based on sensor readings.==

  

**Results**==:==

==We evaluate our approach in simulation using the CARLA simulator. The results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including traditional POMDP approaches and deep learning methods without POMDPs. Our approach is able to navigate to a goal in an unknown environment with high accuracy and robustness, even in the presence of dynamic obstacles.==

  

**Conclusion**==:==

==In this study, we have presented a novel approach for navigation in unknown environments using POMDPs and deep learning. Our results show that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and has the potential to enable more robust and adaptive navigation systems for robots in unknown and dynamic environments. Future work includes the application of this approach to real-world robots, and the exploration of more complex environments and tasks.==
