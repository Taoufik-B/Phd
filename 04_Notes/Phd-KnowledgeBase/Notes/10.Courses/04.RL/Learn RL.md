The main characters of RL are the **agent** and the **environment** . The environment is the world that the agent lives in and interact with. At every step of interaction, the agent sees a(possibly partial) observation of the state of the world, and then decide on a action to take. The environment changes when the agent acts on it, but may also change its own.

  

The agent also perceive a **reward** signal from the environment, a number that tells it how good or bad the current world state is. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward. Called **return**.
