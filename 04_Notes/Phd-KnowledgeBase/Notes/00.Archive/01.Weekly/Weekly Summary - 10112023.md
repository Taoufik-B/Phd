Hello! Let's summarize the progress of your PhD research on autonomous vehicles in the context of POMDPs applied within the CARLA environment:

  

**Research Topic:**

Exploration of a unified framework for decision-making in autonomous vehicles within complex, dynamic, and partially observable environments, leveraging POMDP, MPC, and Probabilistic Robotics.

  

**Problem Statement:**

The challenge lies in enhancing decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles navigating through multi-agent urban scenarios, where traditional control strategies fail to address the uncertainties and dynamics inherent to such environments.

  

**Use Case for Initial Implementation:**

Urban Intersection Navigation, chosen due to its complexity with multiple interacting agents and the need for real-time decision-making under uncertainty.

  

**Proposed System Architecture:**

A layered approach has been outlined, including:

1. **Sensing Layer**: Integrating raw data from various sensors and processing it for subsequent layers.

2. **State Estimation & Probabilistic Robotics Layer**: Generating refined state estimates and probabilistic assessments of the environment.

3. **Decision-making Layer**: Utilizing POMDP to determine optimal actions and MPC for executing control commands.

4. **Control Layer**: Translating decisions into physical actuations for vehicle navigation.

5. **Learning & Adaptation Layer**: Implementing feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

6. **Simulation & Validation**: Testing the framework in virtual environments before real-world trials.

7. **Communication Layer**: Facilitating data exchange with other vehicles and infrastructure.

  

**Main Inputs and Outputs**:

Each layer's primary inputs and outputs have been identified, indicating the interconnectivity and data flow within the system.

  

**Research Progress:**

- A comprehensive problem statement and detailed objectives for the research have been developed.

- Potential use cases and initial system architecture have been proposed.

- The synthesis of the layered framework has been conceptualized, with a focus on integrating POMDP, MPC, and Probabilistic Robotics.

- Considerations have been made for the initial phases of implementation, with an emphasis on urban intersection navigation as a starting point.

- Discussions on systemic inputs and outputs have laid the groundwork for designing the detailed architecture.

  

**Next Steps:**

- Formulating detailed methodologies for each layer.

- Developing a prototype of the decision-making framework.

- Setting up simulation scenarios in CARLA to test the prototype.

- Planning for real-world data collection and testing, following virtual validation.

  

**Outstanding Items:**

- Finalizing tools and methods for system modeling, possibly using SysML.

- Establishing quantitative metrics for system evaluation and validation.

- Identifying potential collaborations for real-world testing and data sharing.
